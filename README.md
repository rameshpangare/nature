# The world is animated by the wind. This invisible, mysterious force can bring a landscape alive. Its absence can cast a calm stillness over the earth. On barren mountain tops its power is barely perceptible; in forests and seas its presence becomes manifest.

Winds are wild, and sometimes destructive. When we look deeply into the nature of wind, when we reflect on its life, its journey to us, we can see the interconnected nature of all things. The light from the sun travels to the surface of the earth, where air is heated unevenly over land and sea causing it to expand and rise at different rates until this rising and displacing air builds in billowing gusts that rock the oceans and ripple the seas. The wind can make rag-dolls of trees, ripping them from their roots.
